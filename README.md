# Car Market
**About**
<br>
This is a simple demo app on a backend API for an car market app.  Users can buy and sell their car the app using this API.
<br><br>
**Note**
<br>
For the sake of simplicity, I have deployed this API to heroku with SQLite to quickly test its functionalities.  You are free to setup your own server environment and use your preferred database system.
<br><br>
**Use**
<br>
I am also making an mobile app to consume this API to show how it interacts with other programs.  You can visit [here](http://github.com/ctrl-alt-del/car-market-android) to check out my Android app.
